,,1,,Tie Breakder (for the 4 Type questions),"Running a business is a lot like hunting out in the wild. 

Below, you'll see a table of four different animals' hunting styles. Each one represents a different approach to business. 

For example, in Row #1, the animal hunts alone and has a very low success rate (only 8%). But when the animal catches it's prey, it keeps 100% the reward. In business terms, this might mean taking bigger risks and needing 1-2 years to start seeing success in your business.

Based on the table below, which row sounds MOST like your business personality?","Row #1 (A = Tiger)
Row #2 (B = Lion)
Row #3 (C = African Wild Dog)
