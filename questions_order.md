   Running a business is a lot like hunting out in the wild.

  Below, you'll see a table of four different animals' hunting styles. Each one represents a different approach to business.

  For example, in Row #1, the animal hunts alone and has a very low success rate (only 8%). But when the animal catches it's prey, it keeps 100% the reward. In business terms, this might mean taking bigger risks and needing 1-2 years to start

  Based on the table below, which row sounds MOST like your business personality?
